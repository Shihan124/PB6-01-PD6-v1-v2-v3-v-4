# PB6 / PD6 Twin Prime Filter

A novel computational framework to identify and classify twin primes using Prime Base 6 (PB6) and Prime Delta 6 (PD6) functions.

This method introduces a structured and scalable approach to understanding twin prime distribution patterns using modular arithmetic and filtered classification.
